      <h1>Comet Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>Effective June 8, 2020</p>
      <p>
        This Comet User Agreement ("Terms") applies to your access to and use of
        getcomet.net ("Comet," "we," or "us"). By accessing or using Comet, you
        agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms,
        you may not access or use Comet.
      </p>
      <h2>Age</h2>
      <p>
        You must be 13 years of age or older to access and use Comet.
      </p>
      <h2>Your Account</h2>
      <p>
        To use certain features of Comet, you may be required to create a Comet
        account (an "Account") and provide us with a username and password. By
        creating an account, you agree to these Terms and our
        <nuxt-link to="/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</nuxt-link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your
        Account and anything that happens related to Your Account. Your account
        security is Your responsibility and Comet is not liable for any Account
        security issues. We recommend that you use a strong password that is
        used only with Comet.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior
        written approval.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Your Content
      </h2>
      <p>
        Comet may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or
        other materials (“Content”), including Content created with or submitted
        to Comet by you or through your Account (“Your Content”). We take no
        responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse any of
        Your Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting Your Content to Comet, you represent and warrant that you
        have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to
        Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are
        responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if
        you post or share Content without all necessary rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant
        Comet the following license to use that Content:
      </p>
      <p>
        When Your Content is created with or submitted to Comet, you grant us a
        worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
        transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt,
        prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your
        Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in
        connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known
        or later developed. This license includes the right for us to make Your
        Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or
        publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who
        partner with Comet. You also agree that we may remove metadata
        associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and
        assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Comet that you provide to us
        are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Comet may use such ideas,
        suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content,
        we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any
        time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms, a
        violation of our Content Policy, or if you otherwise create liability
        for us.
      </p>
      <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
      <p>
        Comet may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services,
        which may be posted by other users (“Third-Party Content”). Third-Party
        Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any of
        their websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content
        is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel
        necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such
        Third-Party Content.
      </p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>

        including by following these Terms and the
        <nuxt-link to="/content" target="_blank">Content Policy</nuxt-link>, so

          parameters set forth in our robots.txt file.

      <h2>Copyright, the DMCA & Takedowns</h2>
      <p>
        Comet respects the intellectual property of others and requires that
        users of Comet do the same. We have a policy that includes the removal
        of any infringing materials from Comet and for the termination, in
        appropriate circumstances, of users of Comet who are repeat infringers.
        If you believe that anything on Comet infringes a copyright that you own
        or control, you may send a direct message to Dan#7457 on
        <a href="https://discord.gg/NPCMGSm">Discord</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, please note that if you knowingly misrepresent that any activity
        or material on Comet is infringing, you may be liable to Comet for
        certain costs and damages.
      </p>
      <h2>Indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        Except to the extent prohibited by law, you agree to defend, indemnify,
        and hold Comet harmless, including costs and attorneys’ fees, from any
        claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (a)
        your use of Comet, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation
        of applicable laws or regulations, or (d) Your Content. We reserve the

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT,
        NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, WILL COMET BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL,
        SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING
        TO THESE TERMS OR COMET, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO
        CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE ON COMET THAT IS ALLEGED TO BE DEFAMATORY,
        OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, COMET IS AT YOUR OWN
        DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
        TO YOUR DEVICE OR COMPUTER SYSTEM, OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.

        THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100) OR ANY AMOUNT YOU PAID
        COMET IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE
        CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF
        LIABILITY, INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF COMET HAS BEEN ADVISED
        OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF ANY REMEDY SET FORTH
        HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING
        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.
      </p>
      <h2>Governing Law and Venue</h2>
      <p>
        Except for the government entities listed below: any claims arising out
        of or relating to these Terms or Comet will be governed by the laws of
        New Jersey, other than its conflict of laws rules; all disputes related
        to these Terms or Comet will be brought solely in the federal or state
        courts located in Morristown, New Jersey; and you consent to personal
        jurisdiction in these courts.
      </p>
      <p class="font-weight-bold">Government Entities</p>
      <p>
        If you are a U.S. city, county, or state government entity, then this
        Section "Governing Law and Venue" does not apply to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a U.S. federal government entity: any claims arising out of
        or relating to these Terms or Comet will be governed by the laws of the
        United States of America without reference to conflict of laws. To the
        extent permitted by federal law, the laws of New Jersey (other than its
        conflict of law rules) will apply in the absence of applicable federal
        law. All disputes related to these Terms or Comet will be brought solely
        in the federal or state courts located in Morristown, New Jersey.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make
        changes, we will post the amended Terms to Comet and update the
        Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are
        material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the address
        associated with your Account (if you have chosen to provide an email
        address) or by otherwise providing notice through Comet. By continuing
        to access or use Comet on or after the Effective Date of the revised
        Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree
        to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using Comet before the
        changes become effective.
      </p>
      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding
        your access to and use of Comet. Our failure to exercise or enforce any
        right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such
        right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason,
        held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will
        remain in effect. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or
        obligations under these Terms without our consent. We may freely assign
        these Terms.
